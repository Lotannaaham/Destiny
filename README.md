### 👋 Hi, I’m Destiny Lotanna Aham — a future Full Stack & Blockchain Developer ⚙️

I’m on a mission to master the full web stack and break into the world of smart contracts, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity, currently focusing on:

- **Frontend & Backend** — HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP 🌐  
- **Blockchain Development** — Solidity & Web3 ⛓ 
- **Ethical Hacking** — Python & Kali Linux 🐍🐧  
- **Cybersecurity** — Bash, terminal tools & system hardening 🔐  
- **Version Control** — Git/GitHub for clean workflows ✅  
- **Current Project** — Building a dynamic PHP-based news blog with user authentication📰

I love building secure, scalable, and modern apps — with a clean UI and powerful backend. When I’m not coding, I’m sketching designs in Figma or exploring Linux systems.

**Let’s collaborate to build, secure and decentralize the web — together.** 🚀

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Projects related to blockchain or web development to enhance my skills
